String Assignment

Take a look at the following code:

name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name = 'Alice'
puts name, save_name
What does this code print out? Think about it for a moment before continuing.

**************

Alice
Bob

If you said that code printed

Alice
Bob
you are 100% correct, and the answer should come as no surprise. Now, let's look at something a bit different:

name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name
What does this print out? Can you explain these results?

***************

BOB, BOB

save_name is a reference to name. #upcase! replaces the value of name. save_name still points to name as a reference, so when the value of name changes, the value of save_name changes as well.

I need to remember this. It is not intuitive to me.
